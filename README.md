# Presentation Inconsistency Analyzer ðŸ”Ž

A Python tool that uses the **Gemini 2.5 Flash API** to scan PowerPoint presentations (`.pptx`) and detect inconsistencies in **text** and **images** across all slides.  
It acts like an **expert business analyst**, reviewing your presentation for contradictory data, conflicting claims, and mismatched timelines.

  2. **Contradictory Textual Claims** (e.g., inconsistent market descriptions)
